    <h2>About me</h2>
<img src="images\viktoria2.jpg" alt="Viktoria2">
<p> My name is <mark>Viktoria.</mark> I like art, music, history and nature. 
     Below is a list of 5 facts about me:
<ul> 
    <li>My favorite book is <i>The Accursed Kings</i> by Maurice Druon</li>
    <li>My favorite music band is <strong>ACDC</strong></li>
    <li>My favorite movie is Harry Potter</li>
    <li>My favorite quote is <q>Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.</q> <cite> Winston Churchill</cite></li>
    <li>My favorite subject at school was <em>math</em></li>
</ul>
    </p>
<p>I study design because I am a creative person and I like painting. Also, I have an unusual hobby, I like to study <b>genealogy</b> and the history of my family. 
    When I have free time, I read archival materials on the website of the <abbr title="Central Historical Archive of Moscow">CHAM</abbr>. 
    So far I have been able to find my ancestors before the 17<sup>th</sup> century. 
    In my opinion, history is much more interesting to read when you know where your ancestors were at that time.</p>

    I would prioritize my hobbies in the following order:
<ol>
    <li>Music</li>
    <li>Illustration</li>
    <li>Genealogy</li>
    <li>History</li>
</ol>
