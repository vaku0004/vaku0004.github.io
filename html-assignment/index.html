<main>article> <h1>About me</h1>
<p> My name is Victoria, I love art, music, history. 
    I study design because I consider myself a creative person and I like to draw. Below is a list of 5 facts about me:
<ul> 
    <li>My favorite book is <i>The Cursed Kings</i> by Maurice Druon</li>
    <li>My favorite music group is <strong>AC DC</strong></li>
    <li>My favorite movie is <b>Harry Potter</b></li>
    <li>My favorite quote <q>Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.</q> <cite> Winston Churchill</cite></li>
    <li>I like sour marmalade</li>
</ul>
    </p>
<p>I have an unusual hobby, I like to study <em>genealogy</em> and the history of my family. 
    When I have free time, I read archival materials and study the history of their lives. 
    So far I have been able to find my ancestors before the 17 <sup>th century</sup>. 
    In my opinion, history is much more interesting to read when you know where your ancestors were at that time.</p>
