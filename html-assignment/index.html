    <h3 id="int">Introduction</h3>
    
<p> My name is <mark>Viktoria.</mark> I like art, music, history. 
    I am a creative person and I like painting.I chose the Interactive Media Design program because it seems to me interesting and in demand in the future. I am interested in studying illustration, web design, motion design and video production. I hope that this knowledge will help me in the future.</p> 
    
    <p>Also, I have an unusual hobby, I like to study <b>genealogy</b> and the history of my family. 
        When I have free time, I read archival materials on the website of the <abbr title="Central Historical Archive of Moscow">CHAM</abbr>. 
        So far I have been able to find my ancestors before the 17<sup>th</sup> century. 
        In my opinion, history is much more interesting to read when you know where your ancestors were at that time.</p>
