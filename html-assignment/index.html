    <h2>About me</h2>
<p> My name is <mark>Victoria</mark>, I like art, music, history. 
     Below is a list of 5 facts about me:
<ul> 
    <li>My favorite book is <i>The Accursed Kings</i> by Maurice Druon</li>
    <li>My favorite music group is <strong>ACDC</strong></li>
    <li>My favorite movie is <b>Harry Potter</b></li>
    <li>My favorite quote is <blockquote>Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.</blockquote> <cite> Winston Churchill</cite></li>
    <li>My favorite subject at school was <em>math</em></li>
</ul>
    </p>
<p>I study design because I am a creative person and I like to draw. Also I have an unusual hobby, I like to study <em>genealogy</em> and the history of my family. 
    When I have free time, I read archival materials and study the history of their lives on the website of the <abbr title="Central Historical Archive of Moscow">CHAM</abbr> archive. 
    So far I have been able to find my ancestors before the 17<sup>th</sup> century. 
    In my opinion, history is much more interesting to read when you know where your ancestors were at that time.</p>
